Welcome to my Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) Notes repository! I’m a third-year IT engineering student passionate about software development, particularly Java app development and web development. With experience in cybersecurity and a strong background in app and web technologies like Firebase, Android Studio, Node.js, React.js, MongoDB, and Tailwind CSS, this repository serves as a consolidated space for DSA concepts and solutions in Java.

🔥 About the Project
This repository is my personal collection of DSA notes and optimized solutions to common DSA problems, primarily solved using Java. It covers a variety of algorithmic concepts, from basics to more advanced topics, and includes solutions to selected LeetCode, CodeChef, and HackerRank problems. These notes are created to serve as a quick reference for myself and others, especially students, for understanding and implementing essential DSA techniques.

📁 Repository Structure
The repository is organized by topics and categories, making it easy to navigate and find solutions for different data structures and algorithm types.

Each topic folder includes:

A README.md file describing the data structure/algorithm, its purpose, complexity, and common use cases.
Java files implementing various problems and algorithms within that topic.
🌐 Topics Covered
Arrays and Strings: Sorting, searching, sliding window, two-pointer techniques.
Linked Lists: Implementations of singly, doubly, and circular linked lists with common operations.
Stacks and Queues: Stack and queue operations, LRU Cache, and applications.
Trees and Graphs: Binary trees, AVL trees, graph traversals (DFS, BFS), and shortest path algorithms.
Hashing: HashMap, HashSet usage, and collision handling.
Dynamic Programming (DP): Basic to advanced DP problems, memoization, tabulation, knapsack, and subset problems.
Sorting and Searching Algorithms: Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Binary Search, etc.
Recursion and Backtracking: N-Queens, Sudoku solver, and permutations.
Greedy Algorithms: Optimal job scheduling, coin change, and interval scheduling.

📝 Notes & Study Tips
Throughout the journey of solving DSA problems, I’ve focused on:

Writing clean and efficient code.
Using optimized algorithms for better performance.
Understanding and explaining time and space complexity.
Keeping solutions modular and easy to understand.
Each Java file is designed to be self-contained and can be run independently. I avoid excessive comments to keep the code clean, relying on naming conventions to make the code self-explanatory.
