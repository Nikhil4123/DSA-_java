# Strings

This folder contains Java and Python solutions for string-related data structure and algorithm problems, organized by difficulty:

- `Easy/` — Beginner-friendly problems and basic operations
- `Intermediate/` — Moderate-level problems
- `Hard/` — Challenging problems

Each subfolder contains both Java (`.java`) and Python (`.py`) solutions for each problem.

## Getting Started
- Browse the subfolders by difficulty.
- Each file is self-contained and runnable.
